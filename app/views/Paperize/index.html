							Have you ever tried to read an interesting article on your tablet or smartphone with the sun shining bright? Or do you know how it feels to sit in front of your PC for hours? What do you do if you don’t have internet connection? We know all these situations and that’s why we don’t like reading web-based News or Articles on our device. It is very uncomfortable to search for interesting articles for hours, you feel tired after some time and reading outside depends hardly on the weather. So how do we solve these problems? By going back to the roots!

						<p class="description">
							We want to go back to the roots. This means that we want you to understand the meaning of reading on paper. Reading on paper means to be independent of internet connection, weather or battery. You can easily transport paper in your bag or throw it away if you don’t need it anymore. Or lend it to your friends and family, so you can inform and speak about a special topic! Don’t forget: Paper makes us social.
